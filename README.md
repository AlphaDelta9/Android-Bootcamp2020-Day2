<br/>
If you want to save a small data, especially a primivite data type, shared preferences is the best choice. Shared Preferences lets you save

    Device File Manager in android studio > data > data > your_apps_package > shared_pref

for security purpose, you can encrypt your key and value data before saving the data to xml.
